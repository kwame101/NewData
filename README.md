# SubwayPass

# You are required to model the following fare card system which is a limited version of New Yorkâ€™s subway card system. At the end of the test, you should be able to demonstrate a user loading a card with $30, and taking the following trips, and then viewing the balance.

# - Taking the Subway from 5th to Pelham Parkway
# - Taking the 15 bus from Pelham Parkway to Bronx 
# - Taking Subway from Pelham Parkway to Guns Hill

# The system should favour the customer where more than one fare is possible for a given journey. E.g. 5th to Pelham Parkway is charged at $2.50.

# Stations and zones:
# Station        | Zone(s)
# 5th            | 1
# Pelham Parkway | 1, 2
# Bronx          | 3
# Guns Hill      | 2

# Fares:     
# Journey                       | Fare
# Anywhere in Zone 1            | $2.50
# Any one zone outside zone 1   | $2.00
# Any two zones including zone 1| $3.00
# Any two zones excluding zone 1| $2.25
# Any three zones               | $3.20
# Any bus journey               | $1.80

# The maximum possible fare is therefore $3.20.
